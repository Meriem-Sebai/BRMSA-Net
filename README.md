# BRMSA-Net: Disclosing concealed colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images via Boundary Recalibration and Multi-Scale Aggregation Network
This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation of our Biomedical Signal Processing and Control paper: [BRMSA-Net: Disclosing concealed colorectal polyps in colonoscopy images via Boundary Recalibration and Multi-Scale Aggregation Network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809425005944).

### Environment
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv BRMSANet`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source BRMSANet/bin/activate`
- Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Training
- Download the pretrained weights of MiT-b3 [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w59gNxY0z68XnJT4sHOiYM5lgy3tgE7g?usp=sharing).
- Run `sh train.sh` for training. 
### Testing
- Download the trained weights of the BRMSA-Net model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ytot6mxZWTDwFHymiEp099LbmTVmHYly?usp=sharing).
- Run `sh test.sh` for testing.
### Evaluation
- Use the prediction maps generated by the testing code or download them directly [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1muYxmzbnZYUF95E49hLXf7H_AYjrCXME?usp=sharing).
- Run `sh eval.sh` for evaluation.
